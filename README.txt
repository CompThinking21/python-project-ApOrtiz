This python project was created as a quiz to give accurate results on what crystals belongs to the users by the questions it asked. 
I started the project with listing what each crystal is and what their descriptions are to be added to end at the results. After creating the list, 
I began to use inputs to place what the quiz will say when it pops up to the user. Followed by that is the questions whether the user wants to take the quiz or no, 
when the user answers yes it gives a “yayy” response if the user answers “no” then its response is “boo you suck” and shuts the program down.  
To do that I used the “if” and “else” statements.  Once the user gives a “yes”, the first questions would show up, followed by the rest of them with the options of answers from a – e. 
Each questin was used by using "input", "if" and "elif" statements.  
The crystal names were used as variables for values of five so at the end of the quiz it can calculate what crystal would be assigned to the user by adding up each value after the user selects the answer.  
If the user answers a different response that isn’t a –e it will print out “Sorry, I don’t understand that answer.” 
After 5 questions it will calculate the answer by using the “for” and “if” statements to calculate the answer. Once it calculates the answer it 
will print out "Your crystal is the " + winning_crystal["name"] + winning_crystal["description". 
Each answer will have a description of the crystal so the user will know what it is and its benefits.  
The reason for this project is to help users find a perfect crystal for them and to help them understand the uses of them. 
This is different from looking up online because this gives questions that they could relate to and helps them find accurate crystals that will benefit them.
